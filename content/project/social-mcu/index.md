## __About the Project__
This is a group project that used Python and Gephi to conduct network analysis of Marvel characters (MCU and comics) to understand the key characters in Phase 1 and predict characters for movie sequels.  This was done as part of the MITB Social Analytics module.  

### Coming Soon to a Theatre Near You
Detailed write-up on the project page to be done.  
In the meantime, links to the report and presentation slides can be found above.
