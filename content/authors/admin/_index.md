I love tangling with new technologies, working with R, R Shiny and Python in exploring data and creating impactful visualisations and dashboards for data-driven decisions.  I enjoy problem solving especially with other team members, to ask better questions, and generate new ideas and insights.  

Combined with my HR expertise, I’m also experienced in working with People data to enhance HR functions and productivity, and help leaders make better People decisions for the organisation.
