abstract: Performing Spatial Point Pattern Analysis (SPPA) can be computationally intensive for larger data sets, or data with non-uniform observation windows.  It can take a day or more to run a dataset of 7,000 points.  There is also often a need to repeatedly apply the same method to different cuts of data (e.g. running the same tests for different regions, subtypes), or when mapping and visualising the results of the analysis.  This talk looks at the K-test and compares the performance of a for-loop function, a functional programming function using purrr, and parallelization.  I also share the code for parallelizing the envelope simulations that are OS agnostic.
